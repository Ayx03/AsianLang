# AsianLang
Much better than the C and C++ programming language
## Features
- Values like `0.99` are not allowed in out language, it's so close that you should make it `100%`.
- Every variable name must begin with `A`, or `error code 0x01: disappointment` will show up.
- No standard libs provided at all, you should be able to build everything from scratch on your own.
