# AsianLang
Much better than the C and C++ programming language. Perfect for Asians.
## Features
- Values like `0.99` are not allowed in our language, it's so close that you should make it `100%`.
- Every variable name must begin with `A`, or `error code 0x01: disappointment` will show up.
- We decided to provide the most powerful GC feature in the entire world. Coming soon.
- No standard libs provided at all, you should be able to build everything from scratch on your own.
- We dare you to ask for a turing complete language here.
## Syntax
- Keywords are in Asian languages.
- You need to define a function with rice.
- These are all uncertain expressions about syntax we had to offer. Don't let us down.
## Implementation
- You should own an AsianLang compiler before you're 9 years old.
## Results
- You'll either receive a discouraging word like `failure`, `stupid` or a interger value that shows how much your cousin or neighbor's code is better than yours.
- You can never find the better solution because we won't let you know how many RAM your program used.
